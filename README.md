# learning-journal

This journal was developed by Patrick Trompeter and Ben Garnaat in the spring of 2016 as part of their Python 401 Code Fellows class.  It allows a user to sign in, create new articles, edit them, and log out.  It is built with python on the pyramid framework, and is designed to be used with a postgres database.
